1. Using a CDN

    The simplest way to include Vue.js is by linking it via a Content Delivery Network (CDN).
    Add the script tag in your HTML file:

    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue@3/dist/vue.global.js"></script>

    This is ideal for simple projects or when you want to quickly experiment with Vue.js without installing anything.

2. Installing via NPM

    If you're using a build system like Webpack, Vite, or Rollup, you can install Vue via npm:

npm install vue

Import it in your JavaScript files:

    import { createApp } from 'vue';
    const app = createApp({});
    app.mount('#app');

    This method is suitable for more complex applications with modular code.

3. Using Vue CLI

    Vue CLI is a powerful tool to scaffold a Vue.js project:

    npm install -g @vue/cli
    vue create my-project
    cd my-project
    npm run serve

    This setup comes pre-configured with Webpack, Babel, and other tools, making it ideal for large-scale applications.

4. Via Vite (Recommended for Vue 3)

    Vite is a modern frontend tool that is fast and optimized for Vue 3:

npm create vite@latest my-vue-app --template vue
cd my-vue-app
npm install
npm run dev

This approach offers a faster development experience with hot module replacement (HMR). 



Computed properties in Vue.js are a powerful feature used to calculate values dynamically based on the component's data. Unlike methods, computed properties are cached based on their dependencies. They only re-compute when one of their dependencies changes, making them efficient and suitable for expensive operations.


Provide and Inject in Vue

In Vue, provide and inject are used for dependency injection, which allows passing data or methods from a parent component to deeply nested child components without prop-drilling (manually passing props through each level).
How provide and inject Work

    provide: The parent component makes a value (data, method, or object) available to its descendants.
    inject: Any descendant component can access the provided value.



custom events those in child components that affect the parent component we use emits:
