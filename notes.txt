1. Using a CDN

    The simplest way to include Vue.js is by linking it via a Content Delivery Network (CDN).
    Add the script tag in your HTML file:

    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue@3/dist/vue.global.js"></script>

    This is ideal for simple projects or when you want to quickly experiment with Vue.js without installing anything.

2. Installing via NPM

    If you're using a build system like Webpack, Vite, or Rollup, you can install Vue via npm:

npm install vue

Import it in your JavaScript files:

    import { createApp } from 'vue';
    const app = createApp({});
    app.mount('#app');

    This method is suitable for more complex applications with modular code.

3. Using Vue CLI

    Vue CLI is a powerful tool to scaffold a Vue.js project:

    npm install -g @vue/cli
    vue create my-project
    cd my-project
    npm run serve

    This setup comes pre-configured with Webpack, Babel, and other tools, making it ideal for large-scale applications.

4. Via Vite (Recommended for Vue 3)

    Vite is a modern frontend tool that is fast and optimized for Vue 3:

npm create vite@latest my-vue-app --template vue
cd my-vue-app
npm install
npm run dev

This approach offers a faster development experience with hot module replacement (HMR).
